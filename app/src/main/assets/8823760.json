On the one hand, I&#x27;d be putting him out of business (and I&#x27;m well poised to scoop up those new prospects). On the other hand, he&#x27;s putting people&#x27;s finances at risk and I feel obligated to say something that the public may not be able to discern.<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","time":1420138085,"title":"Ask HN: Should I report my main competitor for PCI Violations?","type":"story","url":""}
